 We've developed a comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI, leveraging data from our retail operations. This analysis aims to
 provide a deep understanding of our sales performance across various dimensions such as time, geography, and product categories.

                                                                      OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this analysis is to gain actionable insights into our sales performance to drive strategic decisions. Specifically, we aim to:

**Identify Revenue Trends:** Understand how our sales revenue is evolving over time and across different regions.

**Evaluate Product Performance:** Determine which beverage brands are driving the majority of our sales and how they contribute to overall revenue.

**Regional Analysis:** Explore sales performance across different states and regions to uncover potential growth opportunities or areas for improvement.

**Price and Volume Analysis:** Analyze the relationship between price per unit and volume sold to optimize pricing strategies.

**Comparison and Benchmarking:** Compare current sales performance with historical data and industry benchmarks to gauge our competitive position.
